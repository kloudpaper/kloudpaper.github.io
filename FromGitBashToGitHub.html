    <h1>How to create a html file from Gitbash and publish in Git hub?</h1>
   
    <p style="font-size:20px"> This tutorial was written by a very first beginner and attempts to address an audience of the same level. 
    My goal is to walk through from the <a href="http://www.git-srm.com/downloads"> Git Bash </a> and publish in <a href="http://www.github.com">GitHub </a>. 
    Letś start by open a new GitBash terminal 
    </p> 

    <p> <img src="./image1.JPG"> </p> 

    <p> 1. In the above image we start by setting our working directory, type <p class=i> pwd </p> this tells you your working directory, 
    if you are ok with your path leave it, but you can create another special directory with <p class=i>mkdir</p> follow by the name of your new directory.</p>
    
    <p>2. Now you can start by creating a new file using <p class=i>touch</p> follow by the name of your file as FILENAME.html</p>
    <p>3. The real fun now begins with the editor, in my case I will use nano by typing <p class=i>nano </p> followed by the FILENAME.html</p> </p>
    <p>Your terminal should look like this:</p>
    <p><img src="./image2.JPG"></p>
    <p>4. Now you should be able to start your very first webpage, I suggest to review very nice tutorials from W3C schools to learn a bit the structure in html.</p>
    <p>5. At this point you can continue in the nano editor or you can switch to VS code. My suggestion is that you should start in the nano, but as you progress you should switch to VS Studio. But at the beginning, you should 
      start in nano to feel more comfortable to write the code by yourself and then switch to VS studio for advance and more complicated code
    </p>

    <h2>Upload to GitHub</h2>
    <p>1. Now you should have in your working directory your html file and you use image files, they should be in the same directory.</p>
    <p>2. At this point, you should still have open you GitBash Terminal and your VS studio and also your profile in GitHub.</p>
    <p>3. If you still don´t have a profile in GitHub, I encorage you to create one.</p>    
    <p>4. Type <p class=i> git init </p> This starts the github to add your file, make sure you are in the working directory where you have saved your files</p>
    <p>5. Type <p class=i>git add </p>Followed by the FILENAME.html, I suggest to give a proper short name, but if you are like me who loves quite descriptive file names, I suggest to type the first three letters and the TAB key to complete faster</p>
    <p>6. Type <p class=i>git commit -m </p> followed by your "comments of your changes between quotation marks"</p>
    <p>You should receive a message that like there are not more tracked changes</p>
